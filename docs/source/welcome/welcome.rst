What is NESE
=================
NESE is the Northeast Storage Exchange, a shared regional storage collaboration funded by the National Science Foundation and operated as a long term partnership between the Universities and institutions below. Our main goals are to meet the storage needs of the data revolution for science, engineering, education and technology, particularly for researchers in the northeastern part of the U.S.

Currently NESE refers to a large *data-lake* with a Ceph storage backend that presents file, block, and object through various access mechanisms. Please refer to Prodecures for each of these.
